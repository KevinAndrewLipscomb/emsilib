The XSD (XML Schema Definition) files in this folder were provided by
the producer (in this case, the Pennsylvania Health Department
Information Technology Bureau) of the service domain (which I have
designated as "EMSAMS" for EMS Applications Management System).

The CS files in this folder were generated by processing the XSD files
through the Microsoft Xml Schemas/DataTypes support utility (XSD.EXE)
as follows:

  xsd {schema-name}.xsd /classes /namespace:external_data_binding.emsams.{schema-name}
